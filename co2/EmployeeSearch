algo:
Start the program.

Read the number of employees n.

For each employee (repeat n times):
a. Read employee number, name, and salary.
b. Create an Employee object and store it in an array.

Ask the user to enter an employee number to search.

Search the array for a matching employee number:
a. If found, display the employee details and exit the loop.
b. If not found after checking all, display "not found" message.

End the program.
